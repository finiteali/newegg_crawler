**crawler project**

**In this project I was trying to crawl newegg.com and pullout some information :**

*First I wrote a code which had very bad design and it wasnt changeable, and every parts of it was in each other and wasnt readable or changeable.*

*So I need to convert it to a class base code(a code that has many classes and every parts of it is working with classes).*

*So I abstracted every parts of this crawler and convert it to a change and readable code.*

*I have a database for this which has 2 tables(Product, feature) and feature has a foreign key that references to product.*

*I have a admin part which has some facilities (like search products, filtering on companies or id , and ......).*
